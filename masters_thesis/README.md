# Masterâ€™s Thesis: "Decoding the numbers and language behind financial statement fraud"

## Project Overview

**Introduction:** This project utilizes machine learning, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect financial fraud. It's based on a comprehensive dataset derived from financial filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to compare and enhance AI models in identifying fraudulent financial activities. (For more information checkout the [pdf](https://github.com/amitkedia007/Financial-Fraud-Detection-Using-LLMs/blob/main/Detailed_Report_on_financial_fraud_detection.pdf) in the repo)

**Objective:** The goal is to foster a collaborative platform where data scientists and researchers can develop, test, and improve AI models for detecting financial fraud.

## Dataset Description

**Source:** The dataset includes financial filings from 170 companies, split equally between those involved in fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities.

**Structure:** Each dataset entry contains details such as Central Index Key (CIK), filing year, company name, and a categorical indicator of fraud.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps involve text cleaning, tokenization, and transforming data into machine-readable formats, ensuring balanced and fair model training.

## Model Implementation

The project encompasses a variety of models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, BERT and FinBERT, selected for their NLP capabilities and potential in financial statement fraud detection.

## To Reproduce

**Codebase:** Complete code for data extraction, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is available in this repository.

**Environment:** A `requirements.txt` file is provided for setting up a consistent environment.

**Documentation:** Each script is documented with clear instructions in the `README.md`, guiding through environment setup, script execution, and result interpretation.
