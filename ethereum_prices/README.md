# Masterâ€™s Thesis: "Decoding the numbers and language behind financial statement fraud"

## Project Overview

**Introduction:** This project utilizes machine learning, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to 

**Objective:** The goal is to accurately predict the future prices of the cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH).

## Dataset Description

**Source:** The dataset depicts the price of the cryptocurrency Ethereum on a daily basis, has Coinbase as source is public and was taken from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis (FRED) available at the following link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CBBTCUSD.

**Structure:** Each dataset entry contains details such as Central Index Key (CIK), filing year, company name, and a categorical indicator of fraud.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps involve text cleaning, tokenization, and transforming data into machine-readable formats, ensuring balanced and fair model training.

## Model Implementation

The project encompasses a variety of models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, BERT and FinBERT, selected for their NLP capabilities and potential in financial statement fraud detection.

## To Reproduce

**Codebase:** Complete code for data extraction, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is available in this repository.

**Environment:** A `requirements.txt` file is provided for setting up a consistent environment.

**Documentation:** Each script is documented with clear instructions in the `README.md`, guiding through environment setup, script execution, and result interpretation.
